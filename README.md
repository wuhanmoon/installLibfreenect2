# installLibfreenect2
Install libfreenect2 on a Jetson TX1 Development Kit. libfreenect2 is an open source driver for Microsoft Kinect V2.

This repository contains a convenience script to install the prerequisites for building libfreenect and then build the library.

To run the convenience script:

$ ./installLibfreenect2.sh

When installation is complete, the example app 'Protonect' will be in the ~/libfreenect2/build/bin directory.

<h2>Notes</h2>

<h3>USB firmware</h3>
In the current 32 bit (L4T 23.2) and 64 bit (L4T 24.1) releases (as of July 10, 2016) there is an issue in the usb firmware which causes transfer failures with the Kinect V2. NVIDIA has made a firmware patch available. See: 

https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/919354/jetson-tx1/usb-3-transfer-failures/post/4899105/#4899105

As a convenience, that patch is available from this repository, execute:

$ ./firmwarePatch.sh

which will copy the firmware file to the correct directory.

<h3>RGBA→BGRA Patch</h3>
On a 32 bit installation (currently L4T 23.2), there is a difference between the stock libfreenect2 library and the one being installed here. This installation adds a patch to the the example "Protonect.cpp" file. The JPEG decompressor on the Jetson produces RGBA format, where as the viewer consumes BGRA format. The patch adds a simplistic algorithm to rearrange the bytes appropriately. 

If you plan to use this library in production 32 bit code, your application should consider writing specialized code to do the RGBA→BGRA conversion more efficiently.

For 64 bit (currently L4T 24.1), there is no patch applied as the JPEG decompressor produces BGRA format natively.
